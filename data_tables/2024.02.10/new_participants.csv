Patient with the onset of rather unusual symptoms from age 19. Clearly intensifying over the last 3 years. Characterized by episodes of severe fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia. Not associated with fever but alternatively somewhat lower body temperature. Has undergone a workup primarily focused on rheumatologic disorders with no positive findings. She does have a history prior to the onset of symptoms including severe abdominal pain, alternating constipation and diarrhea, cold sweats. Of interest, she does have a cousin in Bulgaria with similar symptoms. Family history is otherwise unknown. On exam today, no tonsillar tissue was visualized or palpable lymph nodes. There is some infectious history with recurrent eye swelling but no episodes of recurrent sinusitis, otitis or pneumonias. Nonetheless, will do screening evaluation for primary immunodeficiency. Consider auto-inflammatory disorder. Check CBC, ESR, and CRP in setting of symptoms.
